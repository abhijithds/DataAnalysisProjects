# Weather Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a weather dataset. The analysis includes various tasks such as finding unique values, counting occurrences, calculating statistics, and creating visualizations. The dataset used for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/abhijithds/Weather-Data-Analyisis/blob/main/weatherDataset.csv).

## Project Overview

The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Visualizations are created to better understand the weather data.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.**
2. **Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.**
3. **Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.**
4. **Find out all the Null Values in the data.**
5. **Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.**
6. **What is the mean 'Visibility'?**
7. **What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data?**
8. **What is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data?**
9. **Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.**
10. **Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.**
11. **What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition?**
12. **What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition?**
13. **Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog.**
14. **Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.**
15. **Find all instances when:**
    - A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50' or
    - B. 'Visibility is above 40'
